SEO doesn't have to be complicated. Focus on these fundamentals and you'll outrank 80% of your competition.

## What Is SEO Really?

Search Engine Optimization means making it easy for Google to:
1. Find your website
2. Understand what you offer
3. Rank you for relevant searches

That's it. Everything else is tactics.

## Why SEO Matters More Than Ever

**The stats**:
- 68% of online experiences begin with a search engine
- First page gets 95% of all traffic
- First result gets 28.5% of clicks
- SEO leads have a 14.6% close rate
- Paid ads have just 1.7% close rate

**Translation**: Rank higher = more customers, for free.

## The 7 SEO Fundamentals

### 1. Page Speed

**What it is**: How fast your website loads.

**Why it matters**:
- Google uses it as a ranking factor
- 53% of mobile users abandon slow sites
- Every second delay = 7% fewer conversions

**How to improve**:
- Compress all images
- Enable browser caching
- Use a fast host
- Minimize code

**Target**: Under 2 seconds on mobile

**Cost**: Usually included in good development

### 2. Mobile Optimization

**What it is**: Site works perfectly on phones.

**Why it matters**:
- 58% of searches happen on mobile
- Google uses mobile-first indexing
- Mobile-friendly = ranking boost

**How to test**: Google Mobile-Friendly Test

**Must-haves**:
- Responsive design
- Readable text (no zooming)
- Tap targets 48px minimum
- No horizontal scrolling

### 3. Quality Content

**What it is**: Helpful content that answers questions.

**Content checklist**:
- Answers a specific question
- At least 500 words minimum
- Includes keywords naturally (not stuffed)
- Easy to read (short paragraphs)
- Updated regularly

**Example**:
❌ "We offer web design services"
✅ "How Much Does Web Design Cost in Austin? Complete 2025 Price Guide"

### 4. Title Tags & Meta Descriptions

These appear in Google search results.

**Title Tag** (The blue clickable headline):
- Include main keyword
- Under 60 characters
- Unique for each page
- Include brand name

Good: "Custom Website Development | Save 70% vs SaaS | Your Company"

**Meta Description** (The gray text):
- Include keyword
- 150-160 characters
- Compelling benefit
- Include call-to-action

Good: "Stop paying monthly website fees. Own your site for one low price. Custom development from $3,500. Free quote in 24 hours."

### 5. Header Structure

Use headings to organize content:
- H1: Page title (only one per page)
- H2: Main sections
- H3: Subsections

This helps Google understand your content hierarchy.

### 6. Internal Linking

Link your pages together:
- Helps Google find all pages
- Distributes ranking power
- Keeps visitors on site longer

**Best practice**: 3-5 relevant internal links per page

Use descriptive anchor text:
✅ "Learn about our custom website development process"
❌ "Click here"

### 7. URL Structure

**Good URLs**:
- \`/services/custom-web-development\`
- \`/blog/website-cost-guide\`
- \`/about/our-team\`

**Bad URLs**:
- \`/page.php?id=123\`
- \`/services/untitled-page-1\`
- \`/p/12345\`

Keep URLs short, descriptive, and keyword-rich.

## Local SEO (For Local Businesses)

If you serve a specific area, do this:

**1. Google Business Profile**
- Claim and verify your listing
- Add all business info
- Upload photos
- Get reviews
- Post regular updates

**2. NAP Consistency**
Name, Address, Phone must be identical everywhere:
- Website footer
- Contact page
- Google Business
- All directories

**3. Location Keywords**
Include your city/region in:
- Title tags
- H1 headings
- Content
- URLs

Example: "Austin Web Development Services"

## Content Strategy That Works

**What to write about**:
1. Questions customers ask you
2. Problems you solve
3. Industry trends and changes
4. How-to guides
5. Comparison posts

**Blog post formula**:
- Target one main keyword
- Answer a specific question
- 800-1,500 words
- Include images
- Clear call-to-action

**Publishing frequency**:
- Quality over quantity
- 2-4 posts per month is plenty
- Consistency matters more than volume

## Technical SEO Checklist

Set these once, then forget:

- SSL certificate (HTTPS)
- XML sitemap submitted to Google
- Robots.txt configured
- Google Search Console set up
- Google Analytics installed
- Schema markup for business info
- 404 page created
- Image alt text on all images

## Common SEO Mistakes to Avoid

**1. Keyword Stuffing**
Don't repeat keywords unnaturally. Write for humans first.

**2. Thin Content**
Pages with under 200 words don't rank. Provide value.

**3. Duplicate Content**
Each page needs unique content.

**4. Ignoring Analytics**
You can't improve what you don't measure.

**5. Buying Links**
Shortcuts get you penalized. Earn links through great content.

**6. Neglecting Mobile**
Test on actual phones, not just browser tools.

**7. Set and Forget**
SEO requires ongoing work. Review quarterly minimum.

## Timeline: What to Expect

**Months 1-3**:
- Small improvements
- Google starts indexing
- Rankings may fluctuate

**Months 4-6**:
- Steady traffic growth
- Some keywords ranking on page 2-3
- Building momentum

**Months 7-12**:
- Significant traffic increase
- Multiple page 1 rankings
- Compounding results

SEO is a marathon, not a sprint.
