  content: `# The $47,000 Mistake Most Small Businesses Are Making Right Now

Last month, I met with Sarah, who runs a successful online coaching business.

"I just calculated what I've spent on Squarespace over 5 years," she said, her coffee untouched. "It's over $12,000, and I still don't own anything."

She'd been paying:
- Squarespace Business: $23/month
- Commerce Basic: $27/month
- Email campaigns: $20/month
- Scheduling: $14/month

**Total: $84/month = $1,008/year**

But here's what really stung: When a competitor offered to buy her business, they valued her website at **zero**. Why? Because she didn't own it.

## The Platform Lock-In Playbook 🪤

How they trap you in 4 sinister steps:

- "Free templates!" *(used by 50,000 other businesses)* 🤖

### Step 2: The Squeeze 🗜️
- Remove our logo? **$49 plan** 🏷️
- More than 3 pages? **Premium** 📄
- SEO controls? **Business plan** 🔍
- Email marketing? **Extra $$$** 💸

### Step 3: The Trap 🕸️
- SEO rankings = platform hostage 📉

- Integrations = proprietary only ⛓️
- Want to leave? Start from **zero** 😭

### Step 4: The Extraction 💰
- 15-30% annual price hikes 📈
- Yesterday's free = today's premium 🎰
- Transaction fees + processing fees 💳
- Export your design? **LOL, no** 🚫

## The "But What If..." FAQ 🤔

**"But what if I need updates?"** 🔄
Modern CMS = DIY updates. Big changes? $500-1000/year beats $3,000+ subscriptions. 💯

**"But what if it breaks?"** 🔧
Maintenance: $50-100/month. Still saving $200+/month. Win-win! 💰

**"But builders are easier!"** 😅
Really? Try:
- Customizing beyond limits ❌
- Adding unsupported tools ❌
- Leaving with your design ❌

**"But I've invested so much!"** 😰
That's sunk cost fallacy. Every month = more money lost. Cut losses NOW! ✂️
