"I just calculated what I've spent on Squarespace over 5 years," Sarah told me. "It's over $12,000, and I still don't own anything."

Between platform fees, commerce, email, and scheduling, she was paying $84 monthly—$1,008 per year. When someone offered to buy her business, they valued her website at **zero**. Because she didn't own it.

## The Real Cost of Website Builders

Here's what these platforms actually cost in 2025:

**Wix Business**: $59/month + email ($10) + bookings ($24.50) = **$93.50/month**
**Squarespace**: $23/month + commerce ($18) + email ($20) + scheduling ($14) = **$84/month**
**Webflow**: $29/month + ecommerce ($42) + forms ($24) = **$95/month**

**5-year total: $5,040–$5,700. What you own: NOTHING**

## The Hidden Costs

Studies show businesses aren't paying the advertised $29/month—they're spending $165 monthly after adding essential apps ($38), transaction fees ($45), and premium support ($15).

That's $1,980 per year. Over five years: **$9,900** before inevitable price hikes.

## The Lock-In Trap

Website builders follow a playbook:

**The Honeymoon**: "Only $12 per month!" (doubles year two). Free templates shared by 50,000 businesses. "No coding" means no control.

**The Squeeze**: Remove their logo? $49. More pages? Premium. Basic SEO? Business plan. Each feature is an upsell.

**The Trap**: Your SEO rankings are locked to their domain. Customer data is locked in their vault. Want to leave? Your design can't be exported, URLs break, SEO work lost.

**The Extraction**: 15-30% annual price hikes. Yesterday's free features become premium. Export your design? No.

## Why 2025 Changes Everything

**Platforms Are Raising Prices**: Squarespace +9%, Wix +12%, Webflow +20% in 2024. More increases coming in 2025.

**Custom Sites Cost 60% Less**: Modern frameworks cut development time from 200+ hours to 60-80 hours. That's $8,000-12,000 in savings.

**Google Punishes Slow Sites**: Core Web Vitals now determine rankings. Website builders consistently fail:

| Metric | Website Builders | Custom Sites | Gap |
|--------|------------------|--------------|-----|
| **LCP** | 4.2 seconds | 1.8 seconds | 2.3x faster |
| **FID** | 120ms | 45ms | 2.7x faster |
| **CLS** | 0.25 | 0.05 | 5x better |

These differences separate page one from page three rankings.

## Real Cost Comparison

Let's see actual numbers for a small business:

### Squarespace (5 Years)
\`\`\`
Monthly: $77
5-Year Cost: $4,620
Ownership: NOTHING
\`\`\`

### Custom Site (5 Years)
\`\`\`
Development: $5,500 (once)
Hosting: $30/month ($1,800 total)
5-Year Cost: $7,300
Ownership: EVERYTHING
Asset Value: $8,000-12,000
\`\`\`

**Break-even**: 4.7 years
**10-year savings**: $5,640 + $10k asset

**Speed**: 60-70% faster load times, perfect Core Web Vitals, A+ mobile scores

**Savings**: Small business $120→$25/month ($95 saved), E-commerce $200→$40/month ($160 saved)

## Why Ownership Matters

**Asset Value**: Custom websites add 2-5x their development cost to your business valuation. That $6,000 site becomes $12,000-30,000 in enterprise value. Rented builders? $0.

**Competitive Edge**: Custom sites rank better, convert 25% more visitors, and create unique experiences competitors can't copy.

**True Freedom**: No hostage situations, no surprise price hikes, no platform shutdowns threatening your business.

## The Bottom Line

### Builder (5 Years)
\`\`\`
Monthly: $100
Total: $6,600
Ownership: NOTHING
\`\`\`

### Custom Site (5 Years)
\`\`\`
Development: $6,000 (once)
Hosting: $1,800
Total: $7,800
Ownership: EVERYTHING
Asset Value: +$10,000
\`\`\`

**Break-even**: 3 years. **Then save $70/month forever.**
