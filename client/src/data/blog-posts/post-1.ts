"I just calculated what I've spent on Squarespace over 5 years," Sarah told me. "It's over $12,000, and I still don't own anything."

Between platform fees, commerce, email, and scheduling, she was paying $84 monthly—$1,008 per year. When someone offered to buy her business, they valued her website at **zero**. Because she didn't own it.

## The Real Cost of Website Builders

Here's what these platforms *actually* cost in 2025:

| Platform | Base | Add-ons | Total/Month | 5-Year Cost |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Wix Business** | $59 | Email ($10) + Bookings ($24.50) | **$93.50** | $5,610 |
| **Squarespace** | $23 | Commerce ($18) + Email ($20) + Scheduling ($14) | **$84** | $5,040 |
| **Webflow** | $29 | Ecommerce ($42) + Forms ($24) | **$95** | $5,700 |

> **After 5 years: $5,040–$5,700 spent. What you own: NOTHING**

## The Hidden Costs

Studies show businesses aren't paying the advertised $29/month—they're spending **$165 monthly** after adding essential apps ($38), transaction fees ($45), and premium support ($15).

That's **$1,980 per year**. Over five years: **$9,900** before inevitable price hikes.

## The Lock-In Trap

Website builders follow the same playbook. It starts with the honeymoon phase: "Only $12 per month!" they promise. But that price doubles in year two. You get free templates—the same ones shared by 50,000 other businesses. "No coding required" sounds great until you realize it also means no control.

Then comes the squeeze. Want to remove their logo from your footer? That's $49. Need more pages? Upgrade to Premium. Basic SEO tools? You'll need the Business plan. Every feature you actually need becomes an upsell.

By the time you're trapped, it's too late. Your SEO rankings are locked to their domain. Your customer data sits in their vault. Want to leave? Your design can't be exported. Your URLs will break. Years of SEO work—gone.

The final stage is extraction. Platforms raise prices 15-30% annually. Features that were free yesterday become premium tomorrow. Export your design and start fresh somewhere else? Not possible.

## Why 2025 Changes Everything

Platform prices are accelerating upward. Squarespace raised prices 9%, Wix by 12%, and Webflow by a shocking 20% in 2024 alone. More increases are coming in 2025.

Meanwhile, custom sites now cost 60% less to build than they did five years ago. Modern frameworks like React and Vue have cut development time from 200+ hours down to 60-80 hours. That translates to $8,000-12,000 in savings compared to older custom development.

Google is also cracking down on slow sites. Core Web Vitals now directly determine your search rankings, and website builders consistently fail these tests:

| Metric | Website Builders | Custom Sites | Gap |
|--------|------------------|--------------|-----|
| **LCP** | 4.2 seconds | 1.8 seconds | 2.3x faster |
| **FID** | 120ms | 45ms | 2.7x faster |
| **CLS** | 0.25 | 0.05 | 5x better |

These differences separate page one from page three rankings.

## Real Cost Comparison

Let's see actual numbers for a small business:

|  | **Squarespace** | **Custom Website** |
|---|---|---|
| **Upfront Cost** | $0 | $5,500 |
| **Monthly Cost** | $77/month | $30/month (hosting) |
| **5-Year Total** | $4,620 | $7,300 |
| **What You Own** | Nothing | Everything |
| **Asset Value** | $0 | $8,000-12,000 |

> **Break-even: 4.7 years** | **10-year savings: $5,640 + $10k asset**

## Results After Switching

Real businesses who made the switch saw dramatic improvements. Load times dropped 60-70%, achieving perfect Core Web Vitals and A+ mobile scores. A small business went from paying $120/month to just $25/month—saving $95 every month. An e-commerce site cut costs from $200/month to $40/month, pocketing $160 in monthly savings.

The growth metrics tell the real story: search rankings jumped 20-40%, conversion rates increased 15-25%, and bounce rates plummeted 30-50%.

## Why Ownership Matters

Custom websites add real value to your business. When you own your site, it contributes 2-5x its development cost to your business valuation. That $6,000 investment becomes $12,000-30,000 in enterprise value. Website builders? They add exactly $0 to your business value because you don't own anything.

Ownership gives you a competitive edge. Custom sites rank better in search results, convert 25% more visitors into customers, and create unique experiences your competitors can't copy with their cookie-cutter templates.

Most importantly, ownership means freedom. No more hostage situations. No surprise price hikes that gut your margins. No platform shutdowns that threaten your entire business overnight.

## The Bottom Line

|  | **Website Builder** | **Custom Website** |
|---|---|---|
| **Upfront Cost** | $0 | $6,000 |
| **Monthly Cost** | $100/month | $30/month (hosting) |
| **5-Year Total** | $6,600 | $7,800 |
| **What You Own** | Nothing | Everything |
| **Asset Value** | $0 | $10,000+ |
| **Break-even** | Never | 3 years |

> **After 3 years, you save $70/month forever.**
