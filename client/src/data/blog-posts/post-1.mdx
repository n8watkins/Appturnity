# The $47,000 Mistake Most Small Businesses Are Making Right Now

Last month, I met with Sarah, who runs a successful online coaching business.

"I just calculated what I've spent on Squarespace over 5 years," she said, her coffee untouched. "It's over $12,000, and I still don't own anything."

She'd been paying:
- Squarespace Business: $23/month
- Commerce Basic: $27/month
- Email campaigns: $20/month
- Scheduling: $14/month

**Total: $84/month = $1,008/year**

<CalloutBox type="warning" title="The Hard Truth">
When a competitor offered to buy her business, they valued her website at **zero**. Why? Because she didn't own it.
</CalloutBox>

## The Platform Lock-In Playbook

How they trap you in 4 steps:

### Step 1: The Honeymoon
- "Only $12/month!" *(billed annually, doubles year 2)*
- "Free templates!" *(used by 50,000 other businesses)*
- "No coding!" *(because you can't touch the code)*

### Step 2: The Squeeze
- Remove our logo? **$49 plan**
- More than 3 pages? **Premium**
- SEO controls? **Business plan**
- Email marketing? **Extra $$$**

### Step 3: The Trap
- SEO rankings = platform hostage
- Customer data = locked in their vault
- Integrations = proprietary only
- Want to leave? Start from **zero**

### Step 4: The Extraction
- 15-30% annual price hikes
- Yesterday's free = today's premium
- Transaction fees + processing fees
- Export your design? **Not allowed**

<CalloutBox type="warning" title="The Truth">

## The "But What If..." FAQ

**"But what if I need updates?"**
Modern CMS = DIY updates. Big changes? $500-1000/year beats $3,000+ subscriptions.

**"But what if it breaks?"**
Maintenance: $50-100/month. Still saving $200+/month. Win-win!

**"But builders are easier!"**
Really? Try:
- Customizing beyond limits
- Adding unsupported tools
- Leaving with your design

**"But I've invested so much!"**
That's sunk cost fallacy. Every month = more money lost. Cut losses NOW!
