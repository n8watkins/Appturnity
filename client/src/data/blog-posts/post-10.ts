  content: `# Website Maintenance: What You Need to Do & When

Websites aren't "set and forget". Regular maintenance keeps your site secure, fast, and effective.

## Why Maintenance Matters

**Without regular maintenance**:
- Security vulnerabilities emerge
- Site gets slower over time
- Bugs and errors multiply
- Google rankings drop
- Forms stop working
- Broken links appear

**Cost of neglect**:
- Hacked site recovery: $5,000-15,000
- Lost sales during downtime: Thousands
- Damaged reputation: Priceless
- SEO ranking recovery: 6-12 months

**Cost of maintenance**:
- DIY: 2-4 hours/month
- Professional: $50-200/month
- Much cheaper than fixing problems later
