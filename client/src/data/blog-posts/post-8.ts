Your website speed affects everything: SEO, conversions, and user experience. Here's why it matters and how to fix it.

## The Impact of Speed

**Speed affects your bottom line**:
- 1 second delay = 7% fewer conversions
- 53% of mobile users abandon sites over 3 seconds
- Google uses speed as a ranking factor
- Fast sites appear more professional

**Real example**:
- Site loading in 5 seconds: 100 visitors = 3 conversions
- Same site in 2 seconds: 100 visitors = 5 conversions
- Result: 67% more conversions from speed alone

## What Is "Fast Enough"?

**Target load times**:
- Excellent: Under 1 second
- Good: 1-2 seconds
- Average: 2-3 seconds
- Poor: 3-5 seconds
- Very Poor: Over 5 seconds

**Most business sites should target**: Under 2 seconds on 4G mobile

## What Slows Down Websites?

The most common culprits:

**1. Huge Images** (40% of speed issues)
- 5MB product photos
- Uncompressed images
- Wrong file formats
- Too many images loading at once

**2. Bloated Code** (30% of speed issues)
- Unused CSS and JavaScript
- Not minified
- Not cached
- Loading everything on every page

**3. Bad Hosting** (15% of speed issues)
- Cheap shared hosting
- Server in wrong country
- No CDN
- Server not optimized

**4. Too Many External Scripts** (10% of speed issues)
- Multiple analytics tools
- Social media widgets
- Ad networks
- Chat widgets

**5. No Caching** (5% of speed issues)
- Browser cache disabled
- No server-side caching
- Every visit loads everything fresh

## How to Check Your Speed

**Free Tools**:
- Google PageSpeed Insights (most comprehensive)
- GTmetrix (detailed analysis)
- Pingdom (simple and clear)
- WebPageTest (advanced testing)

**What to check**:
- Desktop speed
- Mobile speed
- Different locations
- Repeat visits (should be faster with caching)

## Quick Wins for Speed

These make the biggest impact with minimal effort:

**1. Compress All Images**
- Use TinyPNG or Squoosh
- Convert to WebP format
- Target: Under 200KB per image
- Impact: 30-50% faster load time

**2. Enable Compression**
- Turn on Gzip compression
- Reduces file sizes by 70%
- Usually one setting in hosting
- Impact: 20-30% faster

**3. Use Browser Caching**
- Let browsers store files locally
- Users only download once
- Dramatically faster repeat visits
- Impact: 50-70% faster for returning users

**4. Minimize HTTP Requests**
- Combine CSS files
- Combine JavaScript files
- Use CSS sprites for icons
- Impact: 15-25% faster

**5. Use a CDN**
- Content Delivery Network
- Serves files from nearest location
- Especially helps global audience
- Cost: $5-20/month
- Impact: 20-40% faster globally

## Advanced Optimization

For maximum speed:

**Lazy Loading**
- Images load as you scroll
- Don't load offscreen images
- Especially important for long pages
- Easy to implement

**Defer JavaScript**
- Load JavaScript after page content
- Prevents blocking render
- Improves perceived speed

**Critical CSS**
- Inline CSS needed for above-the-fold
- Load rest later
- Faster initial render

**Database Optimization**
- Clean up old data
- Optimize queries
- Use caching layers
- More technical but powerful

**Reduce Redirects**
- Each redirect adds delay
- Audit and minimize
- Update old links

## Platform-Specific Tips

**WordPress**:
- Use WP Rocket or W3 Total Cache
- Limit plugins to 15-20
- Use optimized theme
- Disable post revisions

**Shopify**:
- Optimize theme
- Limit apps to essentials
- Compress images before upload
- Use lazy loading app

**Custom Sites**:
- Server-side rendering
- Code splitting
- Tree shaking (remove unused code)
- Optimize build process

## Mobile Speed

Mobile needs extra attention:

**Mobile-Specific Issues**:
- Slower connections (4G/5G)
- Less powerful processors
- Smaller cache
- Touch targets

**Mobile Optimization**:
- Image sizes for small screens
- Simpler animations
- Minimal JavaScript
- Touch-optimized interface

**Test on Real Devices**:
- iPhone (Safari)
- Android (Chrome)
- Slow 3G simulation
- Different screen sizes

## Hosting Matters

**Shared Hosting** ($5-15/month):
- Good for: Low traffic starter sites
- Speed: 2-4 seconds
- Issues: Slow during traffic spikes

**VPS Hosting** ($20-80/month):
- Good for: Growing sites
- Speed: 1-2 seconds
- Better performance, more control

**Managed WordPress** ($30-100/month):
- Good for: WordPress sites
- Speed: 1-2 seconds
- Optimized specifically for WordPress

**Cloud Hosting** ($10-200/month):
- Good for: Variable traffic
- Speed: 0.5-1.5 seconds
- Scales automatically

## The Speed/Feature Balance

**Some features slow sites**:
- Video backgrounds
- Complex animations
- Many high-res images
- Live social feeds
- Heavy plugins

**Ask yourself**:
- Does this feature add real value?
- Is there a faster alternative?
- Can we lazy-load it?
- Is the slowdown worth it?

**General rule**: If it doesn't directly help conversions, consider removing it.

## Monitoring Speed Long-Term

**Set up monitoring**:
- Monthly speed tests
- Track trends
- Alert on slowdowns
- Test after major changes

**What to track**:
- Page load time
- Time to interactive
- Largest contentful paint
- Cumulative layout shift

**Goal**: Maintain or improve speed over time

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Ignoring Mobile**
Testing only on desktop with fast connection.
**Fix**: Always test on mobile, simulate slow connections.

**Mistake 2: Too Many Plugins/Scripts**
Adding every tool and widget.
**Fix**: Audit regularly, remove unused.

**Mistake 3: Not Compressing Images**
Uploading 5MB photos direct from camera.
**Fix**: Always compress before upload.

**Mistake 4: Cheap Hosting**
Paying $3/month for hosting.
**Fix**: Invest in quality hosting ($20-50/month).

**Mistake 5: No Caching**
Every visitor downloads everything.
**Fix**: Enable all caching options.

## Speed ROI Calculator

**Example site: E-commerce store**

After optimization:
- Load time: 1.5 seconds
- Same 10,000 visitors
