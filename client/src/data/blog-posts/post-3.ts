  content: `# What Nobody Tells You About Website Pricing

Last month, I did something revealing. I posed as different types of businesses and got quotes from 47 web developers and agencies. Same requirements. Same timeline. Same features.

The quotes ranged from $500 to $85,000—for the exact same website.

Here's what I learned about how website pricing really works and how to avoid getting ripped off.

## The Shocking Range in Quotes

Here were the quotes for a 15-page business website with blog, contact forms, and basic SEO:

**Offshore freelancer:** $500-1,500
**Local freelancer:** $3,000-8,000
**Small agency:** $8,000-15,000
**Mid-size agency:** $15,000-35,000
**Large agency:** $25,000-85,000
**Website builder "expert":** $2,000 plus $200 monthly forever

The $85,000 agency and the $8,000 freelancer delivered nearly identical results. The difference? One had a fancy office and 47 people on payroll. The other worked from home.

## What Actually Affects Website Cost

Five main factors determine your final price.

### Number of Pages

Sites with 5-10 pages typically cost $2,500-5,000. These usually include home, about, services, portfolio, and contact pages.

Sites with 10-20 pages run $5,000-10,000. This adds multiple service pages, team bios, case studies, and a blog.

Sites with 20 or more pages cost $10,000-30,000 or more, with complex site architecture, multiple service lines, and extensive content.

### Design Complexity

Template-based design adds $0-1,000. You start with an existing template and customize colors and content.

Semi-custom design adds $1,000-3,000. You get a unique design based on your brand with some custom elements.

Fully custom design adds $3,000-8,000. Everything is designed uniquely for you, including custom illustrations and animations.

### Features and Functionality

Most projects include mobile responsive design, contact forms, SSL certificate, basic SEO setup, Google Analytics, and social media integration in the base price.

Common add-ons include a content management system for $800-2,000, a blog with categories and tags for $500-1,500, basic e-commerce for $2,000-5,000, advanced e-commerce for $5,000-15,000, user login and accounts for $1,500-4,000, payment processing for $1,000-3,000, booking and scheduling systems for $1,500-4,000, email automation for $1,000-2,500, live chat for $500-1,500, multi-language support for $1,500-3,000, advanced search for $1,000-3,000, and custom integrations like CRM connectivity for $1,500-5,000.

### Content Creation

If you provide all content yourself—writing copy, providing images, creating videos—there's no additional cost.

Partial content help costs $500-2,000 for assistance with copywriting, image sourcing, and content structure.

Full content creation runs $2,000-8,000 for professional copywriting, photography, and video production.

### Ongoing Costs

The one-time build is just the start. If you self-manage, expect annual costs of $15-50 for domain name, $100-500 for hosting, and $0-200 for SSL certificate (often free), totaling $115-750 per year.

Managed hosting includes everything above plus updates, backups, and security for $500-2,000 per year.

Full maintenance adds content updates and new features for $2,000-6,000 per year.

## Real Project Examples

### Local Service Business

A plumbing company needed eight pages including a service area map, before-and-after gallery, contact forms, blog, booking system, and Google Business integration.

Cost: $4,800
Timeline: 5 weeks
Annual maintenance: $600 self-managed

### E-commerce Store

A boutique clothing store required fifteen pages with 200 products, shopping cart, payment processing, customer accounts, email automation, inventory management, and size/color variants.

Cost: $9,500
Timeline: 8 weeks
Annual maintenance: $1,200

### SaaS Landing Page

A software company marketing site included twelve pages with custom animations, video backgrounds, pricing calculator, demo booking, CRM integration, multi-step forms, and A/B testing setup.

Cost: $11,000
Timeline: 10 weeks
Annual maintenance: $800

## Why Such a Wide Range

You might see quotes from $500 to $50,000 for what seems like the same project.

Projects quoted at $500-1,000 typically involve template customization with minimal changes, DIY or overseas labor, no custom features, and basic quality.

Projects at $2,500-5,000 include custom design, professional development, mobile responsive layouts, basic features, and quality work.

Projects at $5,000-12,000 feature unique design, advanced functionality, e-commerce or complex systems, professional quality, and ongoing support.

Projects above $12,000-30,000 involve completely custom everything, complex integrations, large scale operations, advanced functionality, and teams of specialists.

## What You're Really Paying For

Website costs break down roughly as follows.

Discovery and planning represents about 10%—requirements gathering, strategy, site mapping, and competitive analysis.

Design accounts for 25-30%—wireframes, visual design, revisions, and design system creation.

Development consumes 40-45%—frontend coding, backend development, feature implementation, database setup, and testing.

Content takes 10-15%—copywriting, image optimization, content entry, and SEO optimization.

Launch and training covers the final 5-10%—final testing, deployment, training, and documentation.

## How to Save Money Without Cutting Quality

Start with a smaller site. Build core pages first and add features later as budget allows. This approach saves 20-40%.

Provide your own content. Write copy and provide images yourself to save $1,000-5,000.

Use strategic templates. Apply templates for structure while customizing branding to save $1,500-3,000.

Phase your project into stages—core site first, blog second, e-commerce third. This spreads costs over time and avoids interest charges.

Choose features wisely. Only build what you'll actually use in year one to save $2,000-8,000.

## Mistakes That Waste Money

Having no clear goals leads to rebuilding because you didn't plan properly, wasting $2,000-5,000.

Scope creep—adding features mid-project without adjusting budget—wastes $1,000-8,000.

Choosing based only on price means cheap work often needs to be redone, wasting the full cost of doing it again.

Skipping strategy means building without understanding your audience, resulting in low conversion rates and needing to rebuild.

Not considering ongoing costs leads to surprise maintenance bills wasting $500-2,000 per year extra.

## Custom vs Website Builder: 5-Year Comparison

| | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 | Total | You Own |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------|---------|
| **Website Builder** | $1,116 | $1,200 | $1,280 | $1,350 | $1,420 | **$6,366** | **Nothing** |
| **Custom Website** | $5,500 | $200 | $200 | $200 | $200 | **$6,300** | **Everything** |

Break-even point: 18 months

## How to Budget Your Project

Define must-haves first. What features are absolutely required?

List nice-to-haves separately. What would be great but isn't critical?

Get accurate quotes from 3-5 developers with your specific requirements.

Plan for ongoing costs by budgeting 10-20% of build cost annually for maintenance.

Add a buffer of 10-15% contingency for unexpected needs.

## Payment Structure Options

Most developers offer flexible payment arrangements.

Milestone payments split costs as 30% upfront, 30% at design approval, 30% at development complete, and 10% at launch.

The 50/50 approach divides payment into 50% to start and 50% at launch.

Monthly payments spread costs over the project timeline at $1,000-2,000 per month for 3-6 months.

## Red Flags in Pricing

Watch out for prices that are too cheap. $500 for a "full custom site" means template work or poor quality.

Unclear breakdowns like "Website: $10,000" with no details likely indicate overcharging.

Everything being extra with a low base price but every feature costing more adds up quickly.

No written contract means no clear scope, leading to scope creep and budget overruns.

Pressure tactics like "Price goes up tomorrow" signal unprofessional behavior.

## Green Flags in Pricing

Look for transparent breakdowns with clear pricing for each component.

Ranges with options like "$4,000-6,000 depending on features" show flexibility.

Written proposals with detailed scope and pricing documents protect both parties.

Milestone payments let you pay as work completes.

Clear maintenance options outline ongoing cost choices upfront.

## The Bottom Line

Simple sites: $2,500-5,000
Most businesses: $4,000-8,000
E-commerce: $6,000-15,000
Enterprise: $12,000-30,000+

Annual ongoing costs: $200-2,000

Break-even vs website builder: 12-24 months

After break-even, you save money AND own an asset.
