- ✅ Includes list generation
- ✅ Edge cases and real-world scenarios

**Business Impact**: HIGH - Ensures you prioritize the right leads

---

### 2. **Form Validation** (50 tests - ALL PASSING ✅)

**File**: `server/validation.test.ts`

Tests all form validation schemas:

- ✅ Contact form validation (name, email, message)
- ✅ Chat widget validation (with 500 char limit)
- ✅ Newsletter validation
- ✅ Honeypot field acceptance (server rejects)

**Business Impact**: HIGH - Prevents losing valid leads

---

### 3. **localStorage Management** (34 tests - 33 PASSING ✅)

**File**: `client/src/lib/quizStorage.test.ts`

Tests quiz data persistence:

- ✅ Save and retrieve quiz results
- ✅ Expiration handling (15-minute timeout)
- ✅ Corrupted data handling

- ⚠️ 1 failing: Storage quota exceeded test (minor)

**Business Impact**: MEDIUM - Ensures quiz data persists

---

### 4. **API Endpoints** (30 tests - 23 PASSING ⚠️)

**File**: `server/routes.test.ts`

Tests REST API endpoints:

- ✅ POST /api/contact (6/9 tests passing)

---

### 5. **Email Priority Logic** (55 tests - ALL PASSING ✅)

**File**: `server/email.test.ts`

Tests email priority system:

- ✅ High priority prefix (🔥) for scores >= 32
- ✅ Medium priority prefix (⚡) for scores 24-31
- ✅ No prefix for standard priority
- ✅ Subject line construction

## ⚠️ Known Issues (9 failing tests)

### 1. **reCAPTCHA Mock Issues** (7 tests)

**Location**: `server/routes.test.ts`

**Problem**: Mock setup not resetting between tests correctly. Some tests that should reject low reCAPTCHA scores are accepting them.

**Fix Needed**:

```typescript
beforeEach(() => {
  // Reset mocks BEFORE setting default
  vi.resetAllMocks();

  // Then set default successful reCAPTCHA
  (global.fetch as any).mockResolvedValue({
    json: async () => ({ success: true, score: 0.9 }),
  });
});
```

**Business Impact**: LOW - These are test infrastructure issues, not code bugs

---

### 2. **localStorage Quota Test** (1 test)

**Location**: `client/src/lib/quizStorage.test.ts`

**Problem**: Test expects `saveQuizResults` to handle quota exceeded errors, but it currently doesn't have try-catch.

**Fix Needed**: Add try-catch to `saveQuizResults()`:

```typescript
export function saveQuizResults(results: Record<string, any>): void {
  try {
    const quizData = { results, timestamp: Date.now(), expiresAt: Date.now() + QUIZ_EXPIRATION_MS };
    localStorage.setItem(QUIZ_RESULTS_KEY, JSON.stringify(quizData));
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn("Failed to save quiz results:", error);
    // Gracefully degrade - app continues without persistence
  }
}
```

**Business Impact**: MEDIUM - Users in private browsing won't be able to save quiz results

---

### 3. **IntersectionObserver Missing** (1 test)

**Location**: `client/src/test/App.test.tsx`

**Problem**: Test environment doesn't have IntersectionObserver API.

**Fix Needed**: Add to `client/src/test/setup.ts`:

```typescript
global.IntersectionObserver = class IntersectionObserver {
  constructor() {}
  disconnect() {}
  observe() {}
  unobserve() {}
  takeRecords() {
    return [];
  }
};
```

**Business Impact**: LOW - This is just a smoke test
