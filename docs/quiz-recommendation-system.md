# Quiz Recommendation System Documentation

## Overview

The quiz recommendation system analyzes user responses to provide personalized solution recommendations and calculate lead priority scores for efficient lead management.

## Architecture

### Components

1. **`quizRecommendations.ts`** - Core recommendation engine logic
2. **`RecommendationCard.tsx`** - UI component displaying recommendations
3. **`Contact.tsx`** - Integration layer connecting quiz to form submission
4. **`email.ts`** - Backend email template with priority scoring

### Data Flow

## Recommendation Logic

### Solution Types

The system recommends one of four solution types:

| Type | Trigger | Timeline | Investment Range |
|------|---------|----------|------------------|
| **Landing Page** | `projectScope: 'simple-landing'` | 2-3 weeks | Under $3,000 |
| **Professional Website** | `projectScope: 'full-website'` or `'not-sure'` | 4-6 weeks | $3,000-$7,000 |
| **Custom Web Application** | `projectScope: 'custom-app'` | 8-12 weeks | $7,000-$15,000+ |
| **E-commerce Solution** | `projectScope: 'ecommerce-store'` | 6-10 weeks | $7,000-$15,000 |

### Priority Scoring System

Priority scores help prioritize leads based on three dimensions:

#### 1. Budget Score (1-4 points)

| Budget Range | Score | Value |
|--------------|-------|-------|
| Under $3,000 | 1 | `budget-conscious` |
| $3,000-$7,000 | 2 | `standard` |
| $7,000-$15,000 | 3 | `premium` |
| $15,000+ or Flexible | 4 | `enterprise` / `flexible` |

#### 2. Urgency Score (1-4 points)

| Timeline | Score | Value |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 3+ months | 1 | `flexible` |
| 2-3 months | 2 | `planning` |
| 1-2 months | 3 | `normal` |
| Within 2-4 weeks | 4 | `urgent` |

#### 3. Complexity Score (1-4 points)

**Base Score from Project Scope:**
- Landing Page: 1
- Full Website: 2
- E-commerce: 3
- Custom App: 4

**Adjustments:**
- +1 if complex features selected (payment processing, user accounts, booking, integrations, analytics)
- Maximum score: 4

### Total Priority Score

**Formula:** `Budget Ã— Urgency Ã— Complexity`

**Range:** 1-64 points

**Priority Levels:**

| Score Range | Priority Level | Email Prefix | Description |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| 24-64 | ðŸ”¥ HIGH PRIORITY | `ðŸ”¥ HIGH PRIORITY -` | High budget, urgent timeline, complex project |
| 12-23 | âš¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY | `âš¡` | Mid-range opportunity |
| 1-11 | ðŸ“‹ STANDARD PRIORITY | (none) | Standard lead |

### Example Calculations

**Example 1: High Priority Lead**
- Budget: Premium ($7k-$15k) = 3 points
- Timeline: Urgent (2-4 weeks) = 4 points
- Complexity: Custom App + Complex Features = 4 points
- **Total: 3 Ã— 4 Ã— 4 = 48 points (ðŸ”¥ HIGH PRIORITY)**

**Example 2: Medium Priority Lead**
- Budget: Standard ($3k-$7k) = 2 points
- Timeline: Normal (1-2 months) = 3 points
- Complexity: Full Website = 2 points
- **Total: 2 Ã— 3 Ã— 2 = 12 points (âš¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY)**

**Example 3: Standard Lead**
- Budget: Budget Conscious (<$3k) = 1 point
- Timeline: Flexible (3+ months) = 1 point
- Complexity: Landing Page = 1 point
- **Total: 1 Ã— 1 Ã— 1 = 1 point (ðŸ“‹ STANDARD PRIORITY)**

## Updating the System

### Adding a New Solution Type

1. Add to `solutionType` in `quizRecommendations.ts:15`
2. Update `getSolutionName()` with display name
3. Update `getSolutionDescription()` with description
4. Update `getTimelineEstimate()` with timeline
5. Update `buildIncludesList()` for type-specific features

### Modifying Score Calculations

Edit these functions in `quizRecommendations.ts`:
- `getBudgetScore()` - Budget scoring logic
- `getUrgencyScore()` - Timeline scoring logic
- `getComplexityScore()` - Complexity calculation
- `getPriorityLabel()` - Priority level thresholds

### Customizing Email Template

Edit `server/email.ts`:
- **Priority thresholds:** Lines 283-287 (subject) and 188 (badge)
- **HTML styling:** Lines 127-181 (CSS classes)
- **Recommendation box:** Lines 194-224

## Testing

### Test Different Scenarios

```typescript
import { getRecommendation } from '@/lib/quizRecommendations';

// High priority test
const highPriority = getRecommendation({
  projectScope: 'custom-app',
  features: ['payment-processing', 'user-accounts', 'analytics'],
  timeline: 'urgent',
  investment: 'premium'
});
// Expected: priorityScore >= 24

// Standard test
const standard = getRecommendation({
  projectScope: 'simple-landing',
  features: ['contact-forms'],
  timeline: 'flexible',
  investment: 'budget-conscious'
});
// Expected: priorityScore < 12
```

## Best Practices

1. **Review Recommendations:** Periodically review generated recommendations to ensure accuracy
2. **Update Timelines:** Adjust timeline estimates based on actual project delivery times
3. **Monitor Score Distribution:** Track priority score distribution to calibrate thresholds
4. **Customize for Business:** Modify scoring weights based on your ideal customer profile
5. **Test Email Rendering:** Send test emails to verify HTML rendering across email clients

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to consider:

- A/B test different recommendation formats
- Add recommendation confidence scores
- Track conversion rates by recommendation type
- Implement machine learning to optimize scoring
- Add seasonal adjustments (holiday rush, slow periods)
- Industry-specific timeline multipliers
- Custom scoring profiles for different service tiers
