# Blog Article Guidelines

## Formatting Pricing and Data

Never use code blocks (triple backticks) for pricing comparisons or data presentations. Code blocks create an unreadable monospace box that doesn't effectively communicate value to readers. Instead, use structured lists with bold text for visual hierarchy.

When presenting pricing comparisons, create a clear contrast between options. Start each comparison with a bold heading that identifies what's being compared. Use bullet points for the breakdown, with bold emphasis on key numbers and outcomes. For example, show the monthly cost, total investment, ownership status, and asset value in separate lines. This makes it easy to scan and compare at a glance.

For key takeaways within comparisons, use blockquotes to highlight the most important conclusions, like break-even points or total savings over time.

## Images and Visual Content

Less is more when it comes to stock images. Each article should have a maximum of 2-3 images total. The hero image in the metadata is required and appears at the top of every article. Beyond that, only include one mid-article visual if it genuinely illustrates a complex concept that words alone can't convey, and optionally one image at the end for a visual break before the call-to-action.

Decorative filler images between sections break up the reading flow and add no value. They also slow down page load times, which hurts SEO. Every image should earn its place by adding genuine value to the content.

## Section Organization

Use horizontal rules (three dashes: `---`) to create clear visual breaks between major sections of your article. This helps readers understand the structure at a glance and makes the content more scannable. Think of these as chapter breaks in your article.

## Emphasis and Formatting

Use bold text for emphasis and key terms that readers need to remember. Italics work well for subtle emphasis or when mentioning product names. Reserve code formatting (backticks) exclusively for actual code snippets, file paths, or technical terms that are meant to be typed literally.

Blockquotes serve a specific purpose: highlighting key takeaways or summary statements that you want readers to remember. They're perfect for statistics, conclusions, or actionable insights that deserve extra visual weight.

When presenting inline lists within a paragraph, use bullet symbols (•) to separate items. For example: "Rankings +20-40% • Conversions +15-25% • Bounce rates -30-50%". For longer lists that need their own space, use standard bullet points with dashes.

## Layout and Sidebar Content

The Quick Stats sidebar has been removed from all articles. Read time appears in the header and sticky title, and category badges are shown in the header as well. Word counts aren't displayed because users don't need this information—they just want to read valuable content.

The Table of Contents remains on the left sidebar for markdown posts. It features active section highlighting that updates as users scroll, and smooth scrolling when users click on a section. This helps readers navigate longer articles.

## Content Structure and Tone

Every article should open with a strong hook—either a compelling story, a striking statistic, or a thought-provoking question. Personal anecdotes and customer stories work particularly well when they're relevant to the topic. Get to the value proposition quickly; readers should understand within the first paragraph why this article matters to them.

Maintain a direct and conversational tone throughout. The content should be data-driven with cited sources, but not dry or academic. Focus on solutions rather than just problems. While we're selling custom website development, the primary goal is to educate first. When readers trust our expertise and insights, the sales will follow naturally.

Every article should end with a clear call-to-action. Link to the pricing calculator with text like "Calculate YOUR savings →" (use the arrow symbol, not an emoji). The newsletter signup component and Appturnity CTA card are added automatically at the bottom, so you don't need to include those manually.

## SEO and Metadata

All posts must include complete SEO metadata. The `seoTitle` should be different from the display title and optimized for search with relevant keywords. Keep the `seoDescription` between 150-160 characters and make it compelling—this is what appears in search results. Include 5-7 relevant keywords in `seoKeywords`. The `excerpt` should be a compelling summary that works well on blog cards. Set `featured` to true or false depending on whether the post should appear on the homepage.

Use only one H1 heading per article—the title itself. If your content starts with a markdown H1 (`#`), it should match or complement the metadata title. All other headings should be H2 (`##`) or H3 (`###`). This is important for SEO and accessibility.

Always cite sources for data and statistics. Format citations in italics at the end of sections: `*Source: HTTP Archive Web Almanac 2024*`. This builds credibility and allows readers to verify claims.

## Technical Formatting

Tables are automatically styled with beautiful gradients and spacing. Just use standard markdown table syntax, and the styling is handled automatically. Make sure column headers are bold for clarity.

Internal links use standard markdown format. External links automatically render with an arrow icon to indicate they open in a new context. For CTA links, always use bold formatting to make them stand out: `**[Calculate YOUR savings →](#pricing)**`

## Quality Standards

Before publishing any article, verify that it meets these standards: no more than 2-3 images total, no code blocks for pricing or comparisons, horizontal rules between major sections, all data and statistics properly cited, a clear CTA at the end, complete SEO metadata, only one H1 heading, consistent use of bold and italic emphasis, properly formatted tables, and no unnecessary stock images that don't add value.
